# Restaurant App API Documentation

This repository contains the RESTful API documentation for a restaurant app. It provides endpoints for various operations related to restaurant management.

## Functionalities Achieved

1. As per the guidelines, all API functionalities have been implemented. The last API, based on location search, fetches an array containing all the restaurant details in that location.

2. Eight restaurant details have been added to the database for demonstration purpose, including menu items for some restaurants.

3. All restaurant APIs are working correctly and fetch information based on the request method, query, and parameters.

4. The server is running on port number 3010.

5. For testing the APIs, you can use the following sample URL: [http://localhost:3010/api-docs](http://localhost:3010/api-docs) in our case.

## Notes

- Some APIs have been commented out to hide them and shown only the main APIs.
- Please ensure that there are no spelling mistakes in the location names while searching.
- The Menu Item APIs are available to add menu items for specific restaurants.
